- Random variables
- Discrete and continuous probability distributions
- Sampling distributions
- Sampling methods
- Confidence intervals
- Hypothesis testing


## Setup

We will be working with jupyter notebooks. The easiest way to access jupyter is via the Anaconda platform.
Please install Anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com in advance of the workshop.

NB no knowledge of programming is required for this workshop.


## Getting Started
Download this repository to your computer as a ZIP file and unpack it.

Open JupyterLab (within Anaconda) and navigate to the unpacked directory to work with the .ipynb examples.

Alternatively, you can run the notebooks online using Binder: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/johnpinney/sampling_and_hypothesis_testing/master?urlpath=lab)
